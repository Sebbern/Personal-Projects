Shuffle experiment, how many times do you have to shuffle to get a deck that is the exact same as the original deck.

Some rules are given:

1: The deck is always shuffled in the exact same way, I believe it's called a "Riffle Shuffle".
2: Left hand always begins.
3: The deck is shuffled by alternating one card at a time, starting at the bottom.
4: The bottom half of the deck is taken by the left hand, while the top half is taken by the right hand.
5: Each hand must have an equal amount of cards.
